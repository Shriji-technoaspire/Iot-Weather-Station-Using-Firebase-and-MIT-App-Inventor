#define FIREBASE_HOST "Paste URL here"  // Enter the Firebase Database URL Without Https and backslash 
Other than that we need internet connectivity, for which we have to enter our Wi-Fi SSID and Password in definitions.
#define WIFI_SSID "Enter your WiFI SSID"   // Change the name of your WIFI
#define WIFI_PASSWORD "WIFI PASSWORD"      // Change the password of your WIFI 
rest of the code is very simple and self-explanatory, where in we are basically pushing all the data from sensor on Real-time Database of firebase.
void loop()
{
float h = dht.readHumidity();
float t = dht.readTemperature();         // Reading temperature as Celsius (the default)
int r = digitalRead(4);                  // Reading the Rain Sensor Data

Firebase.setFloat ("Temperature",t);
Serial.println(t);
Firebase.setFloat ("Humidity",h);
Serial.println(h);
if (r == 1)
{
Firebase.setString("Rain", "Yeah");
Serial.println("its raining");
}
else
{
Firebase.setString("Rain", "Nah");
Serial.println("no rains today");
}
delay(200);
}
